# AD4S: Best Practices is Fool's Gold

## Making Sound Decisions while Maintaining Momentum

In complex software projects, the concept of "best practices" often becomes a dangerous illusion—a gleaming piece of fool's gold that promises value but ultimately delivers rigidity and false confidence. The challenge lies not in identifying universal "best" approaches, but in developing frameworks that enable sound decision-making while maintaining forward momentum.

### Limit the Expense of Revisiting Complex Decisions

Complex decisions in software development carry high cognitive costs. When teams repeatedly revisit major architectural or design choices without a structured approach, they waste valuable energy and create decision fatigue. AD4S provides a framework for making these decisions with appropriate consideration while documenting the rationale and constraints that informed them. This documentation becomes part of the system's knowledge base, allowing future revisitation to build upon previous understanding rather than starting from scratch.

### Rigor Cannot Be Proceduralized

A common pitfall in traditional methodologies is the attempt to procedualize rigor through checklists and rigid processes. While these tools have their place (particularly in regulated environments), they cannot substitute for genuine understanding and critical thinking. AD4S embraces principles and patterns over procedural mandates, recognizing that true rigor emerges from shared understanding rather than compliance activities.

## Every Company Has Its Own Domain-Specific Language

One size emphatically does not fit all in software design. Every organization develops its own domain-specific language that reflects its unique business context, values, and constraints. 

### Mapping Business Lexicon to Design Entities

The translation of business vocabulary into software design entities represents a critical bridge between business needs and technical implementation. When done well, this mapping creates a ubiquitous language that enables clearer communication across the organization. AD4S emphasizes the importance of this mapping process and provides guidance for maintaining consistency between business concepts and their technical representations.

## Complexity: Essential vs. Accidental vs. Incidental

Not all complexity is created equal. AD4S distinguishes between three types:

1. **Essential complexity**: Inherent in the problem domain and cannot be eliminated
2. **Accidental complexity**: Introduced by our chosen solutions and implementation approaches
3. **Incidental complexity**: Arising from historical decisions, tooling limitations, or organizational factors

Understanding these distinctions enables teams to focus their simplification efforts where they'll have the greatest impact—reducing accidental and incidental complexity while developing strategies to manage essential complexity effectively.

## GxP Approach: Good Practice over Best Practice

Regulated industries like pharmaceuticals use the concept of Good Practice (GxP) rather than claiming universal "best" practices. This subtle but important distinction acknowledges that practices must be appropriate to context and continuously evolving.

### The Lessons Are Everywhere

Good practices can be found across diverse domains—from software engineering to medicine, manufacturing to finance. AD4S draws inspiration from multiple disciplines, recognizing that valuable insights often come from unexpected sources. 

### Artifacts: Work vs. Design vs. Status

Documentation serves different purposes at different times. AD4S distinguishes between:

- **Work artifacts**: Supporting the active development process
- **Design artifacts**: Capturing intentional design decisions and rationales
- **Status artifacts**: Communicating current state to stakeholders

Each type requires different approaches and carries different maintenance burdens.

### Natural Tensions in Systems Design

All software systems embody tensions between competing priorities: security vs. usability, performance vs. maintainability, time-to-market vs. comprehensiveness. Rather than pretending these tensions don't exist or prescribing universal resolutions, AD4S provides frameworks for identifying, discussing, and consciously balancing these trade-offs.

### Realize the Power of Outlining Known Unknowns

Explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty is a strength, not a weakness. By documenting known unknowns, teams create space for exploration and adaptation as new information emerges. This approach transforms potential future surprises into anticipated learning opportunities.

## Fragile Software - Inexperience is the Worst Teacher

All too often, fragile software emerges not from technical limitations but from experiential gaps. Teams without exposure to realistic production conditions, diverse user behaviors, or system evolution over time develop brittle solutions that fail in unexpected ways.

### Beyond Agile Development

While Agile methodologies brought important advances in software development, they are not sufficient for addressing the full spectrum of concerns in complex systems. AD4S builds on Agile foundations while extending beyond them to address broader systemic considerations.

### Saying 'Yes' to Consistency, 'No' to Dogma

AD4S values consistency in application without dogmatic adherence to methodology. Principles should guide practice, but not become constraints that prevent adaptation to unique circumstances.

## Being Reactive is Not Enough

The Reactive Manifesto makes progress over traditional Agile patterns but still suffers from a form of navel-gazing. Its self-concern creates an unhealthy projection onto a system's users, effectively abdicating responsibility for those aspects users don't explicitly request.

A truly antifragile approach recognizes larger contextual boundaries within which systems should (and in certain legal contexts, must) operate. This includes governance and compliance, privacy, ethics, accessibility, inclusion, and sustainability. These considerations cannot be afterthoughts or contingent on user requests—they are fundamental to responsible system design.

## DDD and Higher-Order Software Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) provides valuable patterns for aligning software with business domains. AD4S incorporates DDD principles while extending them to address broader systemic concerns beyond the core domain model.

## Are Regulated Systems All That Different From Commercial Systems?

Traditional thinking creates a false dichotomy between heavily regulated systems and commercial software. In reality, the principles that drive quality in regulated environments are increasingly relevant to all software systems as digital technology becomes more deeply integrated into critical aspects of society. AD4S bridges this gap, applying appropriate rigor without unnecessary bureaucracy.

## Conclusion: Towards Good Practice

Rather than chasing the illusion of universal "best" practices, AD4S encourages the development of contextually appropriate good practices—approaches that balance rigor with pragmatism, consistency with adaptation, and immediate needs with long-term responsibilities. By recognizing complexity and embracing the uniqueness of each organization's context, AD4S provides a more realistic and ultimately more effective framework for software design and development.
