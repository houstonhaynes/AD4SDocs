# MLIR: A Pillar of Modern Compiler Infrastructure

## Introduction: A Revolution in Compiler Technology

Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) has emerged as one of the most significant advancements in compiler technology in recent years. Originally developed at Google and now maintained by the LLVM Foundation, MLIR represents a paradigm shift in how we approach the development of compiler infrastructure. Its unique approach of providing a flexible and extensible framework has enabled innovation across diverse computing domains, from machine learning to embedded systems.

Unlike traditional compiler designs that focus on a single abstraction level, MLIR embraces multiple levels of representation within a unified infrastructure, allowing seamless transitions between high-level abstractions and low-level hardware-specific optimizations. This fundamental characteristic makes MLIR particularly well-suited for the modern computing landscape, which increasingly demands specialized hardware acceleration while maintaining programmer productivity.

## The Core Philosophy: Flexibility Through Dialects

At the heart of MLIR's design is the concept of "dialects" - modular sets of operations that capture the semantics of particular domains or abstraction levels. This dialect-based architecture allows MLIR to represent everything from high-level TensorFlow operations to low-level hardware instructions within a single coherent framework.

The beauty of MLIR's dialect approach is that it enables collaboration between previously disconnected domains. A machine learning model can flow through representations that capture neural network operations, tensor abstractions, parallel computation patterns, and hardware-specific instructions, with each level handled by specialized optimizations while maintaining a consistent underlying infrastructure.

MLIR's philosophy embraces the reality that no single representation is optimal for all problems. Instead, it provides the tools to create and combine specialized representations as needed, while ensuring they can interoperate within a common framework. This approach has proven remarkably effective at addressing the growing fragmentation in the compiler ecosystem.

## Transforming Hardware and Software Integration

One of MLIR's most significant impacts has been in bridging the gap between software frameworks and diverse hardware targets. As computing moves increasingly toward specialized accelerators, the challenge of efficiently mapping software to these devices has become critical.

### OpenAI's Triton: Democratizing GPU Programming

OpenAI's Triton project exemplifies how MLIR can transform domain-specific programming. Triton aims to make high-performance GPU programming accessible to a broader audience of developers without requiring expertise in CUDA or other low-level GPU programming models. 

Triton initially used LLVM IR as its intermediate representation but has recently transitioned to MLIR, a move that offers significant advantages. The MLIR-based implementation provides a more powerful abstraction for representing and optimizing the block-based programming model that Triton employs. This transition has enabled Triton to generate GPU code that can match or even exceed the performance of hand-written alternatives while maintaining a Python-like programming model.

As of early 2025, Triton has expanded to support NVIDIA's latest Blackwell architecture, demonstrating the adaptability of its MLIR-based approach. The performance improvements have been substantial, with Triton-generated kernels achieving performance comparable to highly optimized libraries like cuBLAS in significantly fewer lines of code.

### Tenstorrent's TT-Forge: Accelerating AI Hardware

Another compelling example is Tenstorrent's TT-Forge, an MLIR-based compiler for Tenstorrent's AI accelerator hardware. TT-Forge leverages MLIR's flexibility to create a seamless path from standard machine learning frameworks to specialized AI hardware.

The project defines custom MLIR dialects that abstract computation on Tenstorrent's AI accelerators, with different dialects handling different levels of abstraction:

- The TTIR Dialect serves as a common IR that can be lowered to multiple different backends
- The TTNN Dialect provides an entry point into Tenstorrent's neural network library
- The TTMetalium Dialect enables direct access to lower-level kernels

This multi-level approach allows TT-Forge to maintain compatibility with existing ML frameworks while extracting maximum performance from specialized hardware. The compiler supports diverse AI models and workloads, offering scalability across multi-chip systems while aiming to deliver "great out of the box performance."

### ARM and STM32: Embedded Compilation

MLIR's reach extends into the embedded systems domain as well. The framework includes dialects specifically designed for ARM architectures, such as the ArmSME dialect that targets ARM's Scalable Matrix Extension technology. This enables efficient compilation for ARM-based platforms including the widely used STM32 microcontroller family.

The ARM-focused dialects in MLIR provide operations for working with ARM's specialized instructions and register sets, making it possible to generate highly optimized code for everything from small embedded devices to high-performance ARM-based servers. This is particularly valuable as ARM architectures continue to expand their presence across the computing spectrum.

### AMD: Hardware Design and Verification

AMD has embraced MLIR for both hardware design and compilation. Notably, AMD acquired Nod.ai, a company that developed SHARK (Sharp Heterogeneous Accelerated Runtime Kernel), an MLIR-based high-performance ML compiler and runtime specifically focused on accelerating PyTorch code.

SHARK combines components from IREE and Torch-MLIR with an ML-based autotuner to achieve impressive performance results, including implementations that exceed the performance of other frameworks like OpenAI's Triton in specific workloads.

More broadly, MLIR is being applied to hardware design and verification through projects like CIRCT (Circuit IR Compilers and Tools) and Bᴛᴏʀ2ᴍʟɪʀ. These efforts apply MLIR and LLVM development methodologies to hardware design tools, potentially transforming how ASICs and other specialized hardware are developed and verified.

## Community-Driven Evolution: RFCs and Outreach

What makes MLIR particularly valuable as an infrastructure technology is its vibrant, community-driven development process. The MLIR project maintains an active RFC (Request for Comments) process that guides its evolution through open discussion and collaborative decision-making.

Recent RFCs highlight the community's commitment to improving both the technical capabilities and accessibility of MLIR:

1. **Project Charter and Restructuring**: A November 2024 RFC proposed clarifying MLIR's purpose and restructuring efforts to address perceived stagnation on critical issues, demonstrating the community's focus on maintaining a clear vision amid rapid growth.

2. **MLIR for Beginners Tutorial**: An April 2024 RFC proposed a new tutorial aimed at making MLIR accessible to those without compiler backgrounds, recognizing the need to expand the user base beyond traditional compiler experts.

3. **Verification Order**: Discussions on formalizing how verification is performed in MLIR, ensuring consistency and reliability across the expanding ecosystem of dialects and tools.

The community maintains regular communication channels, including weekly public meetings, an active discourse forum, and recorded talks that are made publicly available. This transparent approach to development has fostered a diverse ecosystem of contributors and users.

## Future Directions: Verif and Beyond

MLIR continues to evolve in exciting directions, with formal verification emerging as a particularly promising area. The community is developing infrastructure for hardware and software verification through projects like Bᴛᴏʀ2ᴍʟɪʀ, which applies MLIR to hardware verification by creating clean interfaces between different verification methods.

Other forward-looking efforts include:

- **Catalyst**: An AOT/JIT compiler for PennyLane that accelerates hybrid quantum programs, demonstrating MLIR's applicability to quantum computing
- **HEIR**: An MLIR-based toolchain developed by Google for compiling programs that utilize homomorphic encryption
- **Mojo**: A new programming language that bridges research and production by combining Python syntax with systems programming capabilities, all leveraging the MLIR ecosystem
- **Fidelity Framework**: A cross-paradigm native compilation architecture built around F#, using MLIR as the central component of its compilation pipeline to generate truly native code across the entire computing spectrum while maintaining strong correctness guarantees

These projects illustrate MLIR's expanding scope beyond traditional compiler applications into emerging computing paradigms.

## Conclusion: A Rich Basis for Embracing Computing's Future
